## What is TaskExecutor?

- TaskExecutor is an interface in Spring that allows for asynchronous execution of tasks.
- It manages threads to handle tasks separately from the main application thread, improving performance and responsiveness.

## Difference between Customized ThreadPoolTaskExecutor, Default ThreadPoolTaskExecutor, and SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor:

- Customized ThreadPoolTaskExecutor: Allows for custom configuration of the thread pool, such as setting core pool size, maximum pool size, and queue capacity. Provides fine-grained control over thread management to optimize performance based on task characteristics and system resources.

- Default ThreadPoolTaskExecutor: Uses default settings to create a thread pool. Tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other, using a single thread. Suitable for simple applications or scenarios where custom thread pool settings are not needed.

- SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor: Lightweight implementation that spawns a new thread for each task. Tasks are executed concurrently, with each task running in its own thread. Ideal for lightweight tasks that can run independently without sophisticated thread management.

## When to use Customized ThreadPoolTaskExecutor, Default ThreadPoolTaskExecutor, and SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor:

- Customized ThreadPoolTaskExecutor: Use when you need precise control over thread management and want to optimize thread pool settings based on task characteristics and system resources.

- Default ThreadPoolTaskExecutor: Suitable for simple applications or scenarios where custom thread pool settings are not required and tasks can be executed sequentially.

- SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor: Ideal for lightweight tasks that can run independently and don't require complex thread management. Use when you need simple asynchronous execution without the overhead of managing a thread pool.
